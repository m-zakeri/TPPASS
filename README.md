 Thermomechanical Properties Predictor for Austenitic Stainless Steels

The research applied a machine learning methodology to assess the high-temperature mechanical characteristics of austenitic stainless steels, focusing on yield stress (YS) and ultimate tensile strength (UTS). The study considered variables such as chemical composition, initial grain size, strain rate, and temperature. The dataset comprised 568 entries with 24 attributes, spanning temperatures from 600 to 1280℃, strain rates from 0.0001 to 100s^(-1), and grain sizes from 0.85 to 650μm.
