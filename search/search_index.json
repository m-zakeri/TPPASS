The study considered variables such as chemical composition, initial grain size, strain rate, and temperature. The dataset comprised 568 entries with 24 attributes, spanning temperatures from 600 to 1280\u2103, strain rates from 0.0001 to 100s^(-1), and grain sizes from 0.85 to 650\u03bcm.</p> <p>The analysis utilized ten models, including nine regression models and one meta-estimator, to predict mechanical properties at high temperatures (MPHT). The gradient boosting regressor (GBR) emerged as the superior model for forecasting YS and UTS, evidenced by R^2 scores of 0.88 and 0.96, respectively, and mean absolute errors of 16.59 MPa for YS and 16.17 MPa for UTS.</p>"},{"location":"dataset/","title":"Dataset","text":"<p>The complete version of the dataset will be made accessible at our GitHub repository (https://github.com/m-zakeri/TPPASS) after the publication approval of our relevant research papers.</p>"},{"location":"faq/","title":"FAQ","text":"<p>You may ask any question by contacting zakeri@ipm.ir.</p>"}]}
